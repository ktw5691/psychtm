\title{Compute difference (WAIC1 - WAIC2) in WAIC and its SE for two models.}
\usage{
waic_diff(l_pred1, l_pred2)
}
\arguments{
\item{l_pred1}{A m1 x D matrix of predictive likelihoods (NOT log-likelihoods) from model 1.}

\item{l_pred2}{A m2 x D matrix of predictive likelihoods (NOT log-likelihoods) from model 2.}
}
\value{
A vector of (1) the difference in WAIC (on the deviance scale)
between models and (2) the standard error of the difference in WAIC.
}
