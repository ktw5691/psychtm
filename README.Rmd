The goal of `psychtm` is to make text mining models and methods accessible for social science researchers, particularly within psychology. This package allows users to

-   Estimate the SLDAX topic model and popular models subsumed by SLDAX, including SLDA, LDA, and regression models;

-   Obtain posterior inferences;

-   Assess model fit using coherence and exclusivity metrics.

## Installation

Once on CRAN, install the package as usual:

``` r
install.packages("psychtm")
```

Alternatively, you can install the most current development version:

-   If necessary, first install the `devtools` R package,

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

### Option 1: Install the latest stable version from Github

``` r
devtools::install_github("ktw5691/psychtm")
```

### Option 2: Install the latest development snapshot

``` r
devtools::install_github("ktw5691/psychtm@devel")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to (1) prepare text documents stored in a data frame; (2) fit a supervised topic model with covariates (SLDAX); and (3) summarize the regression relationships from the estimated SLDAX model.

```{r example}
library(psychtm)
library(lda) # Required if using `prep_docs()`

data(teacher_rate)  # Synthetic student ratings of instructors
docs_vocab <- prep_docs(teacher_rate, "doc")
vocab_len <- length(docs_vocab$vocab)
fit_sldax <- gibbs_sldax(rating ~ I(grade - 1),
                         data = teacher_rate,
                         docs = docs_vocab$documents,
                         V = vocab_len,
                         K = 2,
                         model = "sldax")
eta_post <- post_regression(fit_sldax)
```

```{r reg_summary}
summary(eta_post)
```

``` r

```

## Common Troubleshooting

Ensure that appropriate `C++` compilers are installed on your computer:

-   Mac users will have to download [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and its related Command Line Tools (found within Xcode's Preference Pane under Downloads/Components).

-   Windows users may need to install [Rtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). For easier command line use, be sure to select the option to install Rtools to their path.

-   Most Linux distributions should already have up-to-date compilers.

## Limitations

-   This package uses a Gibbs sampling algorithm that can be memory-intensive for a large corpus.
