## Package Features

-   Bayesian estimation of the SLDAX model and popular models subsumed
    by the SLDAX model, including the SLDA model, LDA model, and
    regression models

-   Estimate SLDAX, SLDA, and regression models with support for both
    continuous and dichotomous outcomes

-   Bayesian posterior inference

-   Model fit assessment using coherence and exclusivity metrics

## How to Cite the Package

## Installation

### Ensure that appropriate `C++` compilers are installed on your computer:

-   Windows users may need to install
    [Rtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/). For easier
    command line use, be sure to select the option to install Rtools to
    their path.
-   Mac users will have to download
    [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) and
    its related Command Line Tools (found within Xcodeâ€™s Preference Pane
    under Downloads/Components).
-   Most Linux distributions should already have up-to-date compilers
    (or if not they can be updated easily).

### Install the `psychtm` package:

-   `psychtm` is not currently available on CRAN, but can be installed
    from this repository
-   If necessary, install the `devtools` R package

``` r
install.packages("devtools")
```

#### Option 1: Install the latest stable development version from the Github source code:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ktw5691/psychtm")
```

#### Option 2: If you are interested in the most recent (untested) development snapshot:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ktw5691/psychtm@devel")
```

## Limitations

-   This package should be considered beta software and is still under
    active development: use at your own risk.
-   Documentation will be expanded in future releases. See the **Getting
    Help** section below.
-   This package uses a Gibbs sampling algorithm that can be
    memory-intensive for a large corpus.

## Getting Help

-   Check out the vignette(s) for a good starting point:

``` r
browseVignettes("psychtm")
```

-   If you think you have found a bug, please [open
    issues](https://github.com/ktw5691/psychtm/issues) and provide a
    [minimal complete verifiable
    example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).
